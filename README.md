# Purpose
The purpose of this website is to showcase my recently learnt skills of HTML and CSS/SCSS while creating a portfolio piece for potential employers and others to view my work. Through this website the user can also access my Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium and Git repository.
# Functionality / features
This contains 4 separate HTML pages (index, blog, animation, skills and contact me). Each of these pages have a navigation bar at the top and at the bottom to get between the different pages. The bottom navigation bar also includes links to my external websites. The site includes some of my previous work in 3D animation shown through images and a video. I have included some transitions on the main banner and links with a colour change on hover in the desktop version. The entire site can be displayed on a mobile, tablet or desktop through the use of media queries. The layout and design change between device size but the primary design remains the same.

# Target audience
The target audience for my portfolio is potential employers or anyone that would like to see either what I have learned or what I am showcasing. 
# Tech stack
For this piece I have used HTML and SCSS written through VS Code. The SCSS was transferred to CSS through an extension. The site tracked through a GitHub repository and deployed through GitHub.io.
